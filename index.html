                 <h2> Busse Lake </h2>
                 <p>Don’t let the name fool you. Lake Busse isn’t actually a lake, but a saltwater lagoon in Southern Sakhalin. What makes it so exceptional and magical? At low tide, massive oyster beds rise from the water. And those are not your Canadian oysters, but giant fresh from the ocean Pacific oysters that you can pick, shuck, and eat right on the spot.</p>
                 <p>Imagine walking across a field of oysters, each one the size of a full meal. It’s a shellfish lover’s dream, unlike anything else on Earth. </p>
                 <p>For me, it’s more than just nature’s wonder, it’s a piece of my heart. My dad built a small eco-hotel there, where every summer our family used to gather to fish, relax, and feast on oysters together. The moments I've spent there are some of my most precious memories.</p>

                 <h2> Gorny Vozdukh </h2>
                  <p>Right in the heart of Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk lies a big hill. Back when I lived on the island, it was my favorite spot to hike, bike, and breathe in the fresh mountain air. The trails lead through valleys, forests, and springs all the way up to a peak with surreal panoramic views. </p>
                  <p>In winter, the hill transforms into a ski resort called Gorny Vozdukh, or “Mountain Air.” It’s not as grand as the Alps or Rockies, but it has its own charm. The slopes are perfect for beginners and intermediate skiers, and the cozy lodges offer a warm retreat after a day on the snow. It's the perfect winter sports escape just minutes from the city. The best part? Night skiing! Under the glow of lights, you get a stunning view of the city spreading wide below. Skiing down those hills, surrounded by pristine nature, is an experience I deeply miss.</p>

                 <h2> Aniva Lighthouse </h2>
                  <p>At the southernmost tip of Sakhalin Island stands the legendary Aniva Lighthouse. Built by the Japanese in the early 20th century, this half-ruined structure has a haunting beauty. It’s perched on a rocky outcrop, surrounded by the vast Pacific Ocean, and accessible only by boat or a long hike.</p>
                  <p>Visiting Aniva is like stepping into another world. The lighthouse itself is a testament to human resilience against nature’s forces. Inside, you can explore the old rooms, climb to the top for breathtaking views, and feel the history that lingers in the air. The journey to get there is an adventure in itself, with rugged landscapes and dramatic coastlines along the way. It’s a place that stirs the soul and ignites the imagination.</p>
